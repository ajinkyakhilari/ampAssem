# Description
This script is designed for the efficient and parallel processing of sequencing data for reference-guided amplicon assembly. It automates the workflow from raw sequencing reads to the assembly of consensus sequences based on a reference genome. The process includes quality control, alignment, variant calling, and consensus sequence generation, optimized for nanopore sequencing data but adaptable to other sequencing technologies.

# Features
Concatenates FASTQ files by barcode
Performs read quality filtering and trimming
Aligns reads to a reference genome
Calls variants and generates VCF files
Produces consensus sequences with optional masking of low-coverage regions
Dependencies
To run this script, you will need the following tools installed and accessible in your system's PATH:

Python 3.x

fastp

minimap2

samtools

Clair3

bcftools

bedtools

bgzip and tabix (typically comes with htslib)

# Installation
For the external tools, please follow the installation instructions provided by each tool's documentation. Ensure each tool is added to your system's PATH so the script can invoke them directly.

# Usage
To use this script, you must provide several parameters including the input directory, reference genome, quality thresholds, and the number of barcodes to process. A typical command might look like this:

python reference_guided_assembly.py --input_dir /path/to/reads --min_length 1000 --max_length 2000 --threads 4 --reference /path/to/reference.fasta --phred_quality 20 --model r941_prom_high_g360 --num_barcodes 96

Parameters

--input_dir: Directory containing FASTQ files organized by barcode

--min_length: Minimum read length to consider

--max_length: Maximum read length to consider

--threads: Number of threads for parallel processing

--reference: Path to the reference genome FASTA file

--phred_quality: Minimum PHRED quality score for reads

--model: Clair3 model to use for variant calling

--num_barcodes: Number of barcodes to process

Output
The script outputs the processed files in a new directory for each barcode under the current working directory. Outputs include filtered FASTQ files, BAM files, VCF files, and the final consensus sequences in FASTA format.
